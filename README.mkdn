This is the Perl distribution HTTP-Engine-FirePHP.

## Description

FirePHP is a Firebug plugin which enables you to log to your Firebug Console
by sending certain HTTP headers in the HTTP response. FirePHP is not just
useful for PHP, though; any server-side application that can manipulate HTTP
headers can log to Firebug.

The FirePHP response headers use the Wildfire protocol. The CPAN module
FirePHP::Dispatcher can generate these headers.

This module then integrates FirePHP::Dispatcher with HTTP::Engine. By
simply using this module, HTTP::Engine::Response gets a C<fire_php()>
accessor through which you can log to FirePHP.

## Installation

HTTP-Engine-FirePHP installation is straightforward. If your CPAN shell is
set up, you should just be able to do

    % cpan HTTP::Engine::FirePHP

Download it, unpack it, then build it as per the usual:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make && make test

Then install it:

    % make install

## Documentation

HTTP-Engine-FirePHP documentation is available as in POD. So you can do:

    % perldoc HTTP::Engine::FirePHP

to read the documentation online with your favorite pager.
